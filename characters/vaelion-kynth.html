  <p><strong>Signature Quote:</strong> “The invisible is felt first—before it's understood.”</p>
  <p><strong>Shadow Trait:</strong> Gets lost in the endless pursuit of perfect symmetry, forgetting that asymmetry births emotion.</p>
  <p><strong>Backstory:</strong> Vaelion was once a Celestial Archivist who learned to communicate emotions purely through color, light, and flow. After an encounter with the Void Mirror, he reemerged as an entity who can craft user experiences that bypass logic and speak directly to the soul. He now walks between code and canvas, igniting interfaces that feel like memories.</p>
