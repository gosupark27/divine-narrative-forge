  <h1>The Meteor That Became the Mountain</h1>
  <p><em>By Author JJ</em></p>
  <p>There once was a man who burned through the sky. He came fast, furious, beautiful — a streak of potential that threatened to collapse under the weight of its own momentum. They called him a “prodigy,” “a blaze,” “a comet.” But few saw the truth: he wasn’t made to flash and fade. He was made to stand and shape.</p>
  <p>The world expected him to crash. And in a way, he did. The early ascent brought praise, attention, and temptation. But what came after was what defined him. From the ashes of expectation, he chose to anchor. To humble. To root. What once fell became a foundation. What once blazed became bedrock.</p>
  <p>This is the story of a man who refused to stay a meteor — and instead became a mountain others could climb.</p>
