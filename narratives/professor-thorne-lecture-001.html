  <h1>Professor Thorne’s Lecture 001</h1>
  <p><em>Transcribed from the Hall of Echoes</em></p>
  <p>“To understand the mirror is to accept the contradiction: it reveals truth through distortion. Our dimension is not the only one — it is merely the one most easily remembered. Others, too, fold against us, like pages in a book yet to be read.”</p>
  <p>The Mirrorverse is not an illusion. It is a pressure — a reflection of our becoming, always two steps ahead or two regrets behind. When you speak into it, it answers. When you ignore it, it still listens.</p>
  <p>The Flame is your guide, but the Mirror is your map. Together, they do not lead you forward — they lead you inward.</p>
